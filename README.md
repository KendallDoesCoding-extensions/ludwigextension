# ludwigextension

This extension is for all the epic Ludbuds of the world! It allows you to by a click of a button, get easy access to all of Ludwig's socials.

<p> 3. Go to the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions)</p>
<p> 4. Tap load unpacked extension</p>
<p> 5. Select the folder where you downloaded the source code to</p>
<p> 6. Pin the extension</p>
<p> 7. Tap the extension, to see if it works</p>

<p>And boom, your done.</p>

<h1> But, Ludwig already has a link with all of his socials? </h1>
<p> I know he has this as a link of all his socials, https://wlo.link/@ludwig already, but I made it in form of a chrome extension, so you don't even need to go to any website/url, link. </p>
