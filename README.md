This extension is for all the epic Ludbuds of the world! It allows you to by a click of a button, get easy access to all of Ludwig's socials. 

# How to add it as a chrome extension?
1. Download the source code, or clone it using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Extract it from the ZIP file to a folder, on your local drive (if you cloned the repo to your local drive then skip this step)
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions [page](chrome://extensions)
4. Tap load unpacked extension
5. Select the folder where you downloaded the source code to
6. Pin the extension
7. Tap the extension, to see if it works

And boom, your done.

# But, Ludwig already has a link with all of his socials? 
I know he has this as a link of all his socials, https://wlo.link/@ludwig already, but I made it in form of a chrome extension, so you don't even need to go to any website/url, link.
